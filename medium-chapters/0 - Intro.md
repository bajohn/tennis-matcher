# Introduction

This series of articles will follow the development of TennisMatcher, a web app that will allow tennis players to set up matches with players in their local area. 

The core components of the app are
- A way to create an open match - a time slot and location where someone is looking to play tennis
- A listing of open matches in a geographic region
- A way to accept a match, and message between players
- A way to record scores after match completion
- A history of recorded matches for each player
- A way to join seasons, for player to compete for a title over a set timespan.
- An Elo-based rating system, creating a rating for each player based on recorded matches
- A simulation framework to tune this Elo rating model
- The service should be freely available to players!
